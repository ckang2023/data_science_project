## Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This is the EDA and Data Modeling project I created for my Stat 302 (Data Science II) class at Northwestern University. 
<br>

This project focuses on data modeling and analysis of the [**COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries**](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh) dataset. The data contains information regarding the COVID-19 related patient impact and hospital utilization as state-specific timeseries from 2020-01-01 to 2021-02-27.
<br>

Essential components of the project are: 
<br>

1.  A long form report (R Markdown file with knitted HTML file) that includes: 
  a.  an introduction of the data and research question.
  b.  an exploratory data analysis that is either motivated by the research question.
  c.  attempts to fit a couple different models and evaluate each model's performance using cross-validation.
  d.  debrief on the predictive modeling results and discussion on the future steps.
2.  An executive summary (R Markdown file with knitted HTML file) detailing the highlights of the data analysis and statistical learning process.
3.  Several R-script files for running the codes for tuning the parameters of competing models.
4.  A data subdirectory for the datasets used, which is divided into processed and unprocessed folders. The processed folder contains a codebook for the modified dataset.
